# Open-Domain-Question-Answering
This program contains 2 parts :  
A retriver, which gets a question and returns contexts that are relevant to the question.  
A reader, which gets a question and a context and return the answer of the question.  
And then we use a function which use these parts and answers a given question.  

The SQUAD dataset is used in this program.
